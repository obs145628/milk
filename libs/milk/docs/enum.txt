Enum are represented in memory as integer scalar, but can only be used as an enumeration of values.
By default it's i32, but it can be changed to another ScalarInt type.

enum MyEnum : u8
{
    FOO = 0;
    BAR; //1
    AB; //2
    CD;= 5,
    EF; //6
};

Define a type MyEnum, and values MyEnum::FOO, MyEnum::BAR,... of type MyEnum.
The values must be integers

Operations:

See operators
The only possible operations are to compare them.
It's possible to do a static cast from scalar to enum, and the other way.
It's exactly as a static_cast using the true underlying type.
