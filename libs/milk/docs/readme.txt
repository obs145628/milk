@TODO
v0:
- all type / class / function defs are visible everywhere
- global variables cannot be accessed
- classes are just a struct, and methods are function which take another parameter as 'this', readonly
- inside classes, we have to use this to accesss the members
- no memory management (every object always alive)
- no templates / concepts / overloading
