A statement is what represent actual source code that get executed at runtime.

A statement can be find in multiple locations of the source file:

[V0]
- the function / method body is a statement



They are several kind of statements:

[V0]

- StatementBlock:
'{' statements list ... ''}'
Combine multiple statements in one. This block is a scope.
All variables defined in that sope are deleted at the end of the scope (in undefined order)


- StatementExpr:
<expr> ';'
The statement is simply an expression, more infos in expr


- StatementVarDef
<vardef> ';'
The statement declare an initialize a new variable, more infos in variables


- StatatementIf
if (condition) <codeif...> [else <codeelse...>]

condition must be executed. codeif executed if condition, otherwhise execute codeelse (if defined)

There is an ambiguity in the grammar with if ... else if ... else ... Last else is connected to the closer if.



- StatementWhile
while (condition) <body>
Executes the loop body as long as the condition is true.


- StatementBreak
break;
Must be inside a loop, break from the current inner loop


- StatementContinue
continue;
Must be inside a loop, go back to the beginning (execute the condition again)

- StatementReturn
return <val> ;
Leave the function and return the specific value.
The expr type must be the same than the return type of the function.
For void function, it's we can use return to simply leave the function: 'return;'
