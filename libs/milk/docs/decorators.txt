Decorators Can be used to add some properties to some definitions.

I don't want to have really powerfull Decorators.
It' only for basic specific stuff, like c naming, struct packing, aligning, etc...


Syntax:
@<name>(str) <def>

It can only be attached to:
- function definition
- struct definition
- global variable definition

eg:
@attr("cdef")
void exit(retcode: i32);

Decorators are parsed, but they have absolutely no effect
