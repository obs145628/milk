[V0]

A boolean is implemented as a struct, but with some custom operators,
and cast rules

struct ImplBool
{
    val: i32
}

Operations

See operators for more informations
We can only compare booleans.
@TODO: update operators

We can static cast from bool to any scalar, and the other way.
val can only be 0 or 1, so the cast assure this using usual bool conversion.

The language define some constants:
- true (val = 1) 
- false (val = 0)
