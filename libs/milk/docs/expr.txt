[V0]

Expressions are anything that have a value (can be a void value)

They are several kind of expressions:

- Constant: literal values for many types

Integer: [0-9]+

Float: [0-9]+[.[0-9]+]

Char: '<char>' can be any printable char in single quotes, or one escaped.
Possible escaped: '\n', '\t'
type is char (alias for u8 or i8)

- Identifier

The identifier can be of many kinds, and has a known typed value.

local variable:
the expression type is a reference to this variable.

named callabale
These are for function and method calls.
They are special because, when they will be overloading, we can't tell which function is called with a simple table lookup.
Another stategy will be needed.
For V0 this is still only a lookup

Name resolution
This is done in that order.
- local variables, from inner to outer scopes.
- function


- Operator expression:

Operators isn't just the usual math operators, call, deference, subscript, and more are also operators.
All informations about operators (syntax, precendence, types) can be found in the operators document









[V-????]
Integer size suffix constant
@TODO: which version

Integer: [0-9]+[<type>] type can be any of i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64. default is i32.
egs: 12, 43u8, 552i64

Float: [0-9]+[.[0-9]+][<type>] type can be any of f32, f64. default is f64
egs: 4.8, 12.4f32, 4f64


[V-???]
Char numeric constant
@TODO: which version
Char: '<char>' can be any ASCII char, or hexa: '\XX' or '\X' (same as '\0X')
egs: 'a', '0', '\0', '\BF'
type is char (alias for u8 or i8)


[V-GLOBAL]
Identifier to global variable.
Identifier can be to a global variable
the expression is a reference to this variable
For name resolutions, global variable is between local variable and functions


[V-???]
String constants
@TODO: which version
Maybe same version that program ref ?
