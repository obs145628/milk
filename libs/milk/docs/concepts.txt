[V-Concept]

A concept defines a list of requirements that must be defined by a type

concept Vector2 {
    def x(): float
    def y(): float
    def clone(): Type::Self

    def __constructor__(Type::self);
}

A concept is defined by a list of requirements
One requirement can be:

Function def: make sure a type implement a specific method
(with corresponding signature)

Inside the concept, the Type is defined, that contains specific information,
relative to the type implementing the concept
- Type::Self: The Corresponding self type.

@TODO
TagConcept: no requirements, but we must say explicitely if ta type (not just struct) has this concept.
